                    Galaxies are sprawling systems of dust, gas, dark matter, and anywhere from a million to a trillion stars that are held together by gravity. 
               </li>
               <li>
                Nearly all large galaxies are thought to also contain supermassive black holes at their centers.

            The  Milky  Way  is  the  galaxy  that  includes  the  Solar System,  with  the  name  describing  the  galaxy's  appearance  from  Earth:  a  hazy  band  of  light  seen  in  the  night  sky  formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. 
             </li>
                <li>
                From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.

                    Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.
